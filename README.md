# BlueGrass Digital Assessment

Completing this assessment took around 6 hours. There are definitely improvements that can still be made but as far as I can tell it matches the design 99% other than the mobile video placeholder I used on desktop as well. I would've also liked to add a bit more functionality & styling such as tooltips and animations but I ran out of time.

The hardest part of this assessment for me was styling some sections for both desktop & mobile - I had to resort to making 2 versions of the header and the first class info section, and using `display: none` with media queries to show the correct one at each breakpoint as I couldn't get them to match using the same HTML elements.
